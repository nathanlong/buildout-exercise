## Front-End Tooling

### Automating Processes

To help make this process efficient, I attached a very simple static
prototyping kit I assembled. Powered by `gulp` it adds:

* Local development previews via the LiveServer module
* Sass, with auto-prefixing and minification
* Simple static includes, allowing modularization and reuse

Everything in this kit was written by me, including the gulp tasks, svg
spriting system, local server setup, etc.

### Static Hosting

For review in this demo, I've connected the git repo to Netlify. Nothing
special, it's just for ease of review.

### Frameworks (or Lack Thereof)

In the spirit of the second bullet point of the 'General' section of
instructions, I've chosen to not utilize a standard framework (like Bootstrap)
and create the interactions manually in JavaScript. I used jQuery for speed of
DOM manipulation, but could rewrite in vanilla JS on request.
